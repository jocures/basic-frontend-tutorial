<!-- This is an HTML comment. They aren't very common these days (not much
  reason to pepper your structure aka markup with comments). However, they
  are useful for teaching purposes.

  This comment is also a valid HTML tag. HTML tags begin with an opening
  bracket "<" and end with a closing bracket ">" -->
<!doctype html>
<!-- The declaration above is the HTML doctype. In the past, there were
  many variations of this to support the capabilities or lack thereof in
  certain browsers. These days, we can get away with the simple one above,
  which is formally called the *HTML5* doctype. -->
<html lang="en">
<!-- In addition to a doctype, every valid HTML page should include an <html>
  tag. Inside of the tag, you'll notice a "lang" attribute. It's best
  practice to include the language of a webpage.

  There are many other attributes, and what they are vary based on the tag
  being used. -->
  <head></head>
  <!-- <head> tags are used to include CSS includes, metadata about a page,
    and other information. For now, we're going to leave it empty. -->
  <body>
  <!-- All of the content on a page belongs inside of a <body> tag. -->
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <!-- This is an example of a heading tag. There are several heading tags
      from <h1> to <h6>. They decrease in size from h1 to h6. Additionally,
      they represent decreasing significance to search engines. -->
  </body>
