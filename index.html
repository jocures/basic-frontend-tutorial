  <!-- We've added a script tag. This lets us load JavaScript into the page.
    You can put this anywhere in the page. Where it goes affects when it is
    loaded. It's not uncommon to see <script> tags in the <head> tag. This
    will make the JavaScript load before the rest of the page. By placing the
    tag down here, we'll load the entire structure of the page before we load
    the code. This is good practice so users can see something as soon as
    possible. Depending on how much code you're loading, it might take a
    noticeable amount of time, which is bad look. -->
