    <!-- <div> tags are used as containers for any content. They don't infer
      any meaning about their contents, only creating structure.
    
      We've added a class attribute named "todo-item". Currently, this won't
      do anything for us, since we haven't declared anything about the class.-->
    <div class="todo-item">
      <!-- This is an <input> tag. These provide different ways for users to
        interact with a page besides just scrolling and reading.

        This tag has the type "checkbox". That creates a small box that you can
        toggle on and off. Input tags are an example of self-closing tags. These
        do not need a matching closing tag, like <body> or <div> do. -->
      <input type="checkbox" />
      <!-- <span> tags are used similarly to <div> tags, they add structure to
        a page. A notable difference between <div> and <span> is that <div>
        tags are block-level elements, while <span> tags are inline elements.

        What this means is that <div> tags will stack vertically by default,
        but <span> tags will be rendered in a line until there is no more
        space. -->
